## Ae4Extractor
# Introduction
Ae4Extractor is a utility for extracting assets from a mobile game **Galaxy on Fire 3: Manticore**, by Deep Silver Fishlabs. 

The game uses a proprietary format for storing its assets. Such format is used for both iOS and Android versions of this game.

# Assets
On iOS the asset archives are delivered in the `.ipa` file of the game with an extension of `.tin`.

On Android the assets are bundled into `.obb` files. Note that these files are not standard Android OBB files.

The game is powered by Abyss Engine developed in-house by Fishlabs. Many files have an extension of `.ae4*`, so it may be safe to assume it means "Abyss Engine 4".
